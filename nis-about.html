                The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) is the government <br>
                agency that has been charged with the responsibility of <br>
                migration management in Nigeria.

            <p class="about-two">
                Over the years, the NIS has witnessed series of changes since it was extracted <br>
                from the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) in 1958. The Immigration Department, as <br>
                it was known then, was extrusted with the core immigration duties under the <br>
                headship of the Chief Federal Immigration Officer (CFIO) and the first to sit on <br>
                that chair was in the person of Mr. EH Harrison. The department in its <br>
                emergent stages inherited the Immigration Ordinances of 1958 for its <br>
                operation. At inception, the department had a narrow operational scope and <br>
                maintained a low profile and simple approach in attaining the desired goes <br>
                and objectives of government. During this period, only the Visa and Business <br>
                Sections were set up.
